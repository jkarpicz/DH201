The history of Washington's collection in particular. As well as an image gallery (either of examples of the artwork or historical / archival material (available digitally) about the public art program / specific installations), a line-graph showing the number of art pieces added by year. Some kind of data visualization looking at the most campuses, artists, and/or types of art that are most well-represented in the collection. And hopefull some sort of map using the latititude / longitude data in the dataset.",
